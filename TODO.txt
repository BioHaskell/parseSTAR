Criterion for chemical shift lists should be:
1. Entries of key prefixed with Assigned_chem_shift_list.
2. Entry _Assigned_chem_shift_list.Sf_category == assigned_chemical_shifts.

Now it is based on frame code which is misleading (and omits useful shifts!)

Should I correct analogous filter for coordinates?
